### Model Description

This SSD300 model is based on the
[SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) paper, which
describes SSD as â€œa method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network".
The input size is fixed to 300x300.

The main difference between this model and the one described in the paper is in the backbone.
Specifically, the VGG model is obsolete and is replaced by the ResNet-50 model.

From the
[Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10012)
paper, the following enhancements were made to the backbone:
*   The conv5_x, avgpool, fc and softmax layers were removed from the original classification model.
*   All strides in conv4_x are set to 1x1.

The backbone is followed by 5 additional convolutional layers.
In addition to the convolutional layers, we attached 6 detection heads:
*   The first detection head is attached to the last conv4_x layer.
*   The other five detection heads are attached to the corresponding 5 additional layers.

Detector heads are similar to the ones referenced in the paper, however,
they are enhanced by additional BatchNorm layers after each convolution.

### Example

In the example below we will use the pretrained SSD model to detect objects in sample images and visualize the result.

To run the example you need some extra python packages installed. These are needed for preprocessing images and visualization.
